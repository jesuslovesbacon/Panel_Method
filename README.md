# Panel_Method
 Panel Method UI in python
 
 This UI will take the NACA# from the users to generate coordinates for the airfoils. Will take in both 4-digit and 5-digit NACA airfoils.
 
 
 Currently, the code can generate the coordinate points for a 4 and 5 digit NACA airfoil. The user enters the specific NACA number,
 number of nodes, and chord length. The code generates the plot of the airfoil with its chamber line and exports the coordinates to Excel.
